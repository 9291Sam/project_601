abstract = {The problem of stabilization of a class of nonholonomic systems that can be transformed into chained form is considered. Since nonholonomic systems cannot be stabilized using smooth and time invariant control, a switching algorithm comprising three distinct steps is employed to stabilize the system. The proposed algorithm allows the system to be reduced into simpler subsystems and affords employing different controllers in each step. Using this approach, desired performance and robustness properties of the feedback control system can be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is established by applying it on a unicycle type system moving on hyperbolic plane. In order to make the controller robust, integral sliding mode control is introduced that guarantees robust stabilization. Simulation results confirm the mathematical developments.}
